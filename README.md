IP address changed after VPN connection.
Location appeared different.
Browsing worked normally.
Slight speed reduction observed when connected.

**Outcome**
Learned how to install and configure a VPN.
Verified IP masking functionality.
Understood VPN encryption and tunneling.
Compared network performance with and without VPN.
